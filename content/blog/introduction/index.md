Hello, world :)

I'm Dillion, a Software Engineer, Developer Advocate, and Content Creator. I'm passionate about **teaching Tech, the Web, and Software Engineering in general**.

I've been writing technical articles for the past two years. I celebrated [2 years writing technical articles here](https://dillionmegida.com/p/2-year-writing-articles/).

I write (and have written for):

- [Dillion Megida](https://dillionmegida.com) (my website)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/dillionmegida/)
- [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/dillion-megida/) #
- [CodeSource](https://codesource.io/author/dillion/) #
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-application-using-react-mongo-db-strapi-and-socket-io) #
- [Soshace](https://soshace.com/author/dillionmegida/) #
- [ContentLab](https://contentlab.io/) #
- and few other public and private publications

The # sign in front of the publications means I was paid for the articles.

As a Content Creator, I love writing on different publications because I believe different organizations have different audiences, and writing for all of them helps me reach out to all those audiences. Additionally, I get to learn from different content reviewers and writers across these different organizations.

I've made more than $5k writing paid technical content. My first paid article was [The Concept of Scope in JavaScript](https://soshace.com/the-concept-of-scope-in-javascript/) on Soshace, of which I was paid $100 (at the time, 36,000 naira). Publishing that article opened more opportunities for me at Soshace, and gradually at other organizations.

## So why am I building this platform?

I've been asked a lot of times about getting into technical writing and making money from it. I wrote a basic getting started article here: [Getting Started with Technical Writing](https://dillionmegida.com/p/getting-started-with-technical-writing/).

I've also helped out few friends of mine who are now doing very well in the writing space.

People still reach out to me, so I thought to create a better, more detailed guide based on all I've learned and my experience in this career.

I want to cover more areas on technical writing, address more questions that I've been asked and will be asked, and help out more people to get into technical writing.

## Benefits of Technical Writing

Here are some of the things I've gained from writing:

- I've connected with a lot of people who read my content
- I've learned about new technologies and tools I never knew before or had a faint idea of
- I've gotten better at writing (the more you write, the more you learn)
- I've made money from writing
- I've been recognized for my writing
- I've stood out a couple of times in my job applications
- I've been open to more and more opportunities in the writing space
- I secured a [Developer Advocate position at Stream.io](https://twitter.com/iamdillion/status/1443201703218647044)
- and many more benefits

## What's in it for you?

The knowledge I'm sharing here is not coming from someone who has figured it all out. I still have a lot to learn in this journey. But, I want to share what has worked for me, and hoping that it works for you too.

Here, I'll share how I've gained the aforementioned benefits.

Want to get started already?

Here's a [roadmap](/roadmap) I've created with links to resources I've written to help you follow a path.
