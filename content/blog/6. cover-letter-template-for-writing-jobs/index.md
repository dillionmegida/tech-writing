In my [previous article](/blog/platforms-to-write-paid-articles), I shared different platforms where you can write paid articles. Your next question may be, "How do I apply for these jobs?". And if it is or not, you've come to the right place still : )

Different jobs have different requirements during application. Some would require that you send in a pitch, and some, a complete draft. Some would require that you share some written articles in the past. And maybe some (especially full-time jobs), you'll need to send in a cover letter, just like every other full-time job.

In this article, I'll share a structure you can use for your cover letter.

I'll share the structure here based on this [Cover Letter Template](https://dillionmegida.com/p/cover-letter-template/) I wrote a while ago. I've had [many people testify](https://twitter.com/iamdillion/status/1476123357095632900?s=20) about it working for them and granting them interviews, which, as they said, is unusual.

## The Template

### Subject

Application for the role of Technical Writer at **[Company Name]**

### Body

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'd love the opportunity to work for **[Company Name]** as a Technical Writer.

Why **[Company Name]**? **[Here, you state why you want to write for the company. What excited you about the company? Is there a particular product they have that you'd love to create content on? Why this company? This section requires that you do your research, so you can clearly state something about the company that matches your interests]**

Why me? **[Here, you share a little about you...from who you are, why you're passionate about writing, and if possible, how long you've been writing]**.

Here are some of my writing achievements that'll make you consider me for the job:

- **[Achievement 1 with reference link]**
- **[Achievement 2 with reference link]**
- ...
- **[Achievement n with reference link]**

**[Here, you can state one particular attribute or skill that you're good at and how it aligns with the role]**

**[Optional]** Do you think I am fit? You can assess my skills with a short writing test if you aren't. **[Give some examples of writing tasks that the recruiter could use to evaluate your skills. You can suggest a draft, an outline, or a short tutorial using the company's product]**.

I am looking forward to hearing more about this opportunity.

## An example

Next, I'll show you an example of this cover letter:

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'd love to work for Backendfor5.

Why Backendfor5? I'm fascinated by the mission that drives the company. Particularly, I love the efforts put into place to make backend tools/languages/frameworks more accessible and as easy to use as possible. I believe I can contribute to the platform's continued success with my skills.

Why me? I'm a Technical writer proficient in building backend services and applications. I'm passionate about constantly learning new topics/tools/terms in Backend development and sharing my knowledge with the community through simplified articles. I've been doing this on my [my personal blog](https://dillionmegida.com) and three other publications for the past three years. Here are some of my writing achievements that'll make you consider me for the job:

- Written over 50 backend articles (on Node.js, Python, and Nest.js) on [my blog](#)
- I've written over six very detailed Python articles on [LogRocket](#), and ten articles on [Smashing Magazine](#)
- I contributed to the [Backend for beginners course](#) on Udemy
- And I'm an active member of Backend communities on Twitter, where we hold spaces from time to time.

I believe I am fit for this role. I'm passionate about community and advocating for backend development and tools. As a constant learner keeping up with the latest trends, I believe these would be valuable to the team.

Are you convinced yet? If not, you can assess my skills with a task. I see that the company has some articles on Node.js and APIs but doesn't have anything on Express + GraphQL. I could develop a short article on this topic to express my skills. And if I hopefully get in, we can make this a more detailed tutorial piece : )

I am looking forward to hearing more about this opportunity.

## Conclusion

I'd love to hear what you think about this template. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
