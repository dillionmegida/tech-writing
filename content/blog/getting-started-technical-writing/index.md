## What is Technical writing

My simple definition of technical writing is **creating written content to share information about tech**.

Tech here is ambigous because it comprises of many things. It's not just web development. It's not just app development. It ecompasses everything that makes tech possible. From management part to the development part to the design part--all of these are tech-related. And articles on them are called Technical Articles.
