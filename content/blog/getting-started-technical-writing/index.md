Hello world :)

I'm Dillion, a Software Engineer, Developer Advocate and Content Creator. I'm passionate about **teaching tech**.

I've been writing technical articles for the past two years. I celebrated [2 years writing technical articles here](https://dillionmegida.com/p/2-year-writing-articles/).
